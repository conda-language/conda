# RAT

### Why Rat?

mmmm cheeeeeeese...
Originally, following a decent amount of Pythonic structure, we began thinking of naming our child after some of the great Snake languages. However, having noticed how popular Python is for its legibility, yet its overall lack of exciting performance, we began to brainstorm ways to leave the Snake game behind. Thus birthing RAT. See, being created from a small group of LMU Computer Scientists, we understand our position as the small language in this wide world of Programming. Yet, unlike in the natural world, we are no prey. We are a: **R**eally. **A**wesome. **T**eam.
